# SagaRevised
SagaRevised emulator for Ragnarok Online 2 : The Gate of the World.

## How to compile

You need to install [.NET Framework 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21) in order to be able to build the emulator. Then launch `build.bat` and it's done.

## Some tips

* Some time the build.bat doesn't work, check the path to `MSBuild.exe` and/or try with administrator privileges.
* If you are stuck at the login screen for no reason, restart the server and before trying to connect into the game type `host -connect` in the Saga.Gateway console. You don't have to do that each time you want to connect, just one time after launching the server.

## Full Client

We use the latest [DiviniaRO2 full client](https://mega.co.nz/#!yZhlkB5S!j6zia8kE_uLZ65WaJavDS-nVvq7-vyDgtGfRIbcmm9E).
